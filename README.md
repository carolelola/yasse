### ADA Essay Questions
  

1. Why do you want join Ada Developers Academy? Why are you interested in programming? Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming.
  
I'm 53 but I grew up around computers since my dad was an EE who designed applications for the government as well as the defense and space industries. He had at least 5 computers at home at all times. I grew up without fear of technology although this seems to be unusual for other many women my age.  
An unexpected divorce prompted me to find stable employment in healthcare during the recession.  Seven years later I have the exact same job which, by nature, offers no opportunity for advancement. These days, the most interesting part of my job is working with EMRs but there are so many errors and pitfalls inherent in the software design.  This is frustrating and makes everyone's jobs more difficult.  I spend my (rare) free time trying to get into the EMR program to fix whatever I can. I want to help people be productive and not be bogged down by poor design.  
What I have learned at my current job is that I love problem solving-not problem accepting. I want things to work efficiently and, if they don't, I want to fix them. 
Being older, I don't have the luxury of taking a few classes here or there in order to change careers at a later date. I need get moving and make changes now and that's why your program is such a great fit for someone like me.  Thank you so much for your consideration.

2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? How do you see yourself impacting the technology field?
  
In 5 years, I hope to be working on projects that challenge me and make me proud. I am a master of finding substance in everything I do but what I am lacking right now is being challenged.  I now know, after working as a Medical Assistant for 7 years, that I must continue learning new things and sharing ideas or I will drown in the monotony of it all. I need to actively be a part of the solution in life-not the problem. 

I have recently become more politically active and would love to find a way to be of service to the LGBTQ community. I am the proud mom of a transgender son and I want to help change the way gender is documented in all software and applications.  This requires programming and education and I am up for the challenge. I want to "be the change I wish to see in this world" (Thanks, Gandhi!) and pave the way for gender equality and LGBTQ rights so as to allow people to not have to, for example,  EXPLAIN themselves in front of strangers (HIPAA violations!) that they do belong at a certain clinic or establishment even though they present themselves in a gender non-binary way.  I'm a mom and I want to make life easier for my son, his community, and those who don't quite mesh with society's antiquated ideas of how we should look and whom we should love. 

3. Read Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement. How will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?

As mentioned before, I am the proud mom of a transgender son so working to include the LBTQ workplace and experience is, I believe, vital to the success of any community. 

I love that ADA's mission will allow talented, well-trained, and diverse people to feel confident with the skills they have been taught so they can compete in the highly competitive tech industry.  Because of the small and close-knit design of this program, ADA provides and encourages a supportive community of women with a shared experience, though a diverse background, to work together and help each other succeed.  The connections made in this program are invaluable and I have seen that the relationships and desire to help each other continues outside of graduation.

This truly is a beautiful concept and it uses the sisterhood approach to helping each other be the best they can be. 
I, myself, would be honored to be a part of the mind-blowing concept that women and gender diverse people can work together to enhance the tech experience for everyone.

4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn? What would you do differently?

When my oldest son was young, I drove him to school every day and for some reason I got in the habit of criticizing him about literally everything. I took advantage of my captive audience and by the time we got to school we were both mad and our goodbyes often involved him slamming the car door and stomping off to school.  

I'm not sure why I hadn't seen how wrong this was, but I didn't until my husband made a snide comment about how stressful mornings were. I was shocked and probably defensive, but he had planted a seed of doubt and the devastating revelation hit me hard. The next day I did more observing than criticizing but the damage had been done.  My son, my little boy, was bracing himself for a fight.  

But there was no fight that day.  I saw how my choice to recklessly criticize him had set us both up to start our days in a negative way.  I thought about the damage I had been doing and how to avoid doing any more.  After school I talked to him and I apologized. I told him that I didn't want to ruin both our days by picking on him every morning and I didn't want our goodbyes to be angry ones.  I promised him that I would work really hard to correct him in a more constructive way and to stop the rushed, verbal vomit that I had been forcing him to endure.  

There is a time and place for criticism and there is a way to do it constructively.  I now know how important it is to teach someone without destroying them. We won't want to better ourselves if doing so breaks us.
I am thankful for my husband's snide comment, even though it hurt.  I am thankful I wasn't too proud to see that he was right.  
I'm not afraid of making mistakes because this is the best way to learn.  I don't look at mistakes as a failure but as a teaching moment. 

I erred; I listened; I accepted; I apologized; I learned; and I implemented.  And 20 years later my amazing son and I have a wonderful, loving, and respectful relationship.
